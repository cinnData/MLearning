# [ML-02] Introduction to Python

## What is Python? 

**Python** is a programming language, introduced in 1991. The current version is Python 3.11. To work with Python, you will pick an interface among the many available choices. You can have several "instances" of a Python interpreter, called **kernels**, running independently in your computer.

Warning: Python is **case sensitive**. So, type is a Python function which returns the type of an object, but Type is not recognized (unless you create a new function with this name), and will return an error message.

## The Anaconda distribution

There are many distributions of Python. In the data science community, **Anaconda** (`anaconda.com`) is the favorite one. The current Anaconda distribution comes with Python 3.9. Downloading and installing Anaconda will leave you with the `Anaconda Navigator`, which opens in the browser and allows you to choose among different interfaces to Python.

Among the many interfaces offered by Anaconda, I recommend you **Jupyter Qt Console**, which is an input/output text interface. Jupyter (Julia/Python/R) is a new name for an older project called **IPython** (Interactive Python). IPython's contribution was the IPython shell, which added some features to the mere Python language. Qt Console is the result of adding a graphical interface (GUI), with drop-down menus, mouse-clicking, etc, to the IPython shell, with a toolkit called Qt.

Part of the popularity of the IPython shell was due to the **magic commands**, which were extra commands written as `%cmd. For instance, `%cd allowed you to change the **working directory**. These commands are not part of Python. Some textbooks and tutorials are still very keen on magic commands, which are occasionally mentioned in this course. To get more information about them, enter `%quickref` in the console. Although, in practice, you can omit the percentage sign (so `%cd` works exactly the same as cd), it is always safer to keep using it to distinguish the magic commands, which are NOT Python, from the Python code.

Jupyter provides an alternative approach, based on the **notebook** concept. In a notebook, you can combine input, output and ordinary text. In the notebook arena, **Jupyter Notebook** is the leading choice. Notebooks are multilingual, that is, they can be used with other languages, like R, besides Python. Most data scientists prefer the console for developing their code, but use notebooks for diffusion, specially for posting their work on platforms like GitHub.

Besides the Jupyter tools, Anaconda also offers a Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called **Spyder**, where you can manage a console and a text editor for your code. If you have previous experience with this type of interface, for instance from working with R in RStudio, you may prefer Spyder to Qt Console.

Alternatively, you can bypass the navigator calling those interfaces in a shell application. To start Qt Console, enter `jupyter qtconsole`. To get access to the notebooks in the default browser, enter `jupyter notebook`. To start Spyder, enter `spyder`.

*Note*. Use *Terminal* in Mac and *Anaconda Prompt* in Windows. Don't use the standard Windows prompt, because it will not find the Anaconda apps unless you specify the path.

## Typing Python code

Let me assume that you are using Jupyter Qt Console, though almost everything would be also valid in other interfaces, with minor adjustments. When you start the console, it opens a window where you can type or paste your code. You can resize the window and zoom inside it as in a browser (*e.g*. Google Chrome).

As the browser, the console can have several tabs working independently. To open a new tab, enter either *Cmd+T* (Macintosh) or *Ctrl+T* (Windows), or use the menu *File >> New tab with New Kernel*. Each of these tabs is an interface between you and a Python kernel. These kernels run independently. 

The console produces input prompts (such as `In[1]:`), where you can type a command and press *Return*. Then Python returns either an output (preceded by `Out[1]:`, a (typically long and difficult) error message, or no answer at all. Here is a supersimple example:

```
In [1]: 2 + 2
Out[1]: 4
```

So, if you enter `2 + 2`, the output will be the result of this calculation. But, if you want to store this result for later use (in the same session), you will enter it with a name, as follows: 

```
In [2]: a = 2 + 2
```

In Pyhton, when you use a name that is already taken, the old assignment is forgotten. Note that the value of 2 + 2 is not shown now. If you want to see it, you have to ask for that explicitly:

```
In [3]: a
Out[3]: 4
```

If you copypaste code from a text editor (which is what you would do if you were working in the console, so you could readily save your code), you can input several lines of code at once. In that case, you will only get the output for the last line. If the cursor is not at the end of the last line, you have to press now Shift+Return to get the output. Here is a simple example:

```
In [4]: b = 2 * 3
   ...: b - 1
   ...: b**2

Out[4]: 36
```

*Note*. You would probably have written `b^2` for the square of 2, but the caret symbol plays a different role in Python.

## Python packages

Many additional resources have been added to Python in the form of **modules**. A module is just a text file containing Python code. Modules are grouped in libraries, also called **packages**, because their elements are packed according to some specific rules which allow you to install and call them together. Python can be extended by more than 300,000 packages. Some big packages, like scikit-learn, are not single modules, but collections of modules, which are then called subpackages.

Since the basic Python toolkit (without any package) is quite limited, you will need additional resources for practically everything. For instance, suppose that you want to do some math, and calculate the square root of 2. You will then **import** the package math, whose resources include the square root and many other mathematical functions. Once the package has been imported, all its functions are available. You can then apply the function `math.sqrt`. This notation indicates that `sqrt` is a function of the module `math`.

In the console, the square root calculation shows up as: 

```
In [5]: import math
   ...: math.sqrt(2)
Out[5]: 1.4142135623730951
```

Alternatively, you can import only the functions that you plan to use:

```
In [6]: from math import sqrt
   ...: sqrt(2)
Out[6]: 1.4142135623730951
```

Packages are imported just for the current kernel. You finish the session by either closing the console or by restarting the kernel. You can do this with *Kernel >> Restart current Kernel* or by typing *Ctrl+.*.

With Anaconda, most packages used in this course are already available and can be directly imported. If it is not the case, you have to **install** the package (only once). There is a basic installation procedure in Python, which uses a package installer called `pip` (see `pypi.org/project/pip`). Using pip you can have a conflict of versions between packages which are related. If this is the case, ayou can use an alternative installer called `conda`, which checks your Anaconda distribution, taking care of the conflicts. Mind that, due to all those checks, `conda` is much slower than `pip`.

## The main packages

This course does not look at Python as a programming language, that is, as one for developing software applications, but from a very specific perspective. Our approach is mainly based on the **package Pandas**.

In the data science context, teh main Python packages are:

* **NumPy** adds support for large vectors and matrices, called there **arrays**.

* Based on NumPy, the library **Matplotlib** is Python's plotting workhorse.

* Pandas is a popular library for data management, used in all the examples of this course. Pandas is built on top of NumPy and Matplotlib.

* scikit-learn is a library of **machine learning** methods.

## Numeric types

As in other languages, data can have different **data types** in Python. The data type can be learned with the function `type`. Let me start with the numeric types. For the variable `a` defined above:

```
In [9]: type(a)
Out[9]: int
```

So, `a` has type `int` (meaning integer). Another numeric type is that of **floating-point** numbers (`float`), which have decimals:

```
In [10]: b = math.sqrt(2)
type(b)
Out[10]: float
```

There are subdivisions of these two basic types (such as `int64`), but I skip them in this brief tutorial. Note that, in Python, integers are not, as in the mathematics textbook, a subset of the real numbers, but a different type:

```
In [11]: type(2)
Out[11]: int
```

```
In [12]: type(2.0)
Out[12]: float
```

In the above square root calculation, `b` got type `float` because this is what the `math` function `sqrt` returns. The functions `int` and `float` can be used to convert numbers from one type to another type (sometimes at a loss):

```
In [13]: float(2)
Out[13]: 2.0
```

```
In [14]: int(2.3)
Out[14]: 2
```

## Boolean data

We also have **Boolean** (`bool`) variables, whose value is either `True` or `False`:

```
In [15]: d = 5 < a
    ...: d
Out[15]: False
```

```
In [16]: type(d)
Out[16]: bool
```

Even if they don't appear explicitly, Booleans may come under the hood. When you enter an expression involving a comparison such as `5 < a`, the Python interpreter evaluates it, returning either `True` or `False`.  Here, I have defined a variable by means of such an expression, so I got a Boolean variable. Warning: as a comparison operator, equality is denoted by two equal signs. This may surprise you.

```
In [17]: a == 4
Out[17]: True
```

Boolean variables can be converted to `int` and `float` type by the functions mentioned above, but also by a mathematical operator:

```
In [18]: math.sqrt(d)
Out[18]: 0.0
```

```
In [19]: 1 - d
Out[19]: 1
```

## Strings

Besides numbers, we can also manage **strings** with type `str`:

```
In [20]: c = 'Messi'
    ...: type(c)
Out[20]: str
```
The quote marks indicate type `str`. You can use single or double quotes, but take care of using the same on both sides of the string. Strings come in Python with many methods attached. These methods will be discussed later in this course.

## Lists

Python has several types for objects that work as **data containers**. The most versatile is the **list**, which is represented as a sequence of comma-separated values inside square brackets. Lists can contain items of different type. A simple example of a list, of length 4, follows.

```
In [21]: mylist = ['Messi', 'Cristiano', 'Neymar', 'Coutinho']
```

```
In [22]: len(x)
Out[22]: 4
```

Lists can be concatenated in a very simple way in Python:

```
In [23]: newlist = mylist + [2, 3]
    ...: newlist
Out[23]: ['Messi', 'Cristiano', 'Neymar', 'Coutinho', 2, 3]
```

Now, the length of `newlist` is 6:

```
In [24]: len(newlist)
Out[24]: 6
```

The first item of `mylist` can be extracted as `mylist[0]`, the second item as `mylist[1]`, etc. The last item can be extracted either as `mylist[3]` or as `mylist[-1]`. Sublists can be extracted by using a colon inside the brackets, as in:

```
In [25]: mylist[0:2]
Out[25]: ['Messi', 'Cristiano']
```

Note that `0:2` includes `0` but not `2`. This is a general rule for indexing in Python. Other examples:

```
In [26]: mylist[2:]
Out[26]: ['Neymar', 'Coutinho']
```

```
In [27]: mylist[:3]
Out[27]: ['Messi', 'Cristiano', 'Neymar']
```

The items of a list are ordered, and can be repeated. This is not so in other data containers.

## Ranges

A **range** is a sequence of integers which in many aspects works as a list, but the terms of the sequence are not saved as in a list. Instead, only the procedure to create the sequence is saved. The syntax is `range(start, end, step)`. Example:

```
In [28]: myrange = range(0, 10, 2)
    ...: list(myrange)
Out[28]: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

Note that the items from a range cannot printed directly. So, I have converted the range to a list here with the function `list`. If the step is omitted, it is assumed to be 1:

```
In [29]: list(range(5, 12))
Out[29]: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
```

If the start is also omitted, it is assumed to be 0:

```
In [30]: list(range(10))
Out[30]: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## Dictionaries

A **dictionary** is a set of **pairs key/value**. For instance, the following dictionary contains three features of an individual:

```
In [31]: my_dict = {'name': 'Joan', 'gender': 'F', 'age': 32}
```

The keys can be listed:

```
In [32]: my_dict.keys()
Out[32]: dict_keys(['name', 'gender', 'age'])
```

In the dictionary, a value is not extracted using an index which indicates its order in a sequence, as in the list, but using the corresponding key:

```
In [33]: my_dict['name']
Out[33]: 'Joan'
```

## Other data container types

The packages used in data science come with new data container types: NumPy arrays, Pandas series and Pandas data frames. Dealing with so many types of objects is a bit challenging for the beginner. The elements of the Python data containers (eg lists) can have different data types, but NumPy and Pandas data containers have consistency constraints. So, an array has a unique data type, while a data frame has a unique data type for every column.

##  Functions

A **function** takes a collection of **arguments** and performs an action. Let me present a couple of examples of value-returning functions. They are easily distinguished from other functions, because the definition's last line is a `return` clause.

A first example follows. Note the **indentation** after the colon, which is created automatically by the console.

```
In [34]: def f(x):
    ...:     y = 1/(1 - x**2)
    ...:     return y
```

When we define a function, Python just takes note of the definition, accepting it when it is syntactically correct (parentheses, commas, etc). The function can be applied later to different arguments.

```
In [35]: f(2)
Out[35]: -0.3333333333333333
```

If we apply the function to an argument for which it does not make sense, Python will return an error message which depends on the values supplied for the argument.

```
In [36]: f(1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-34-281ab0a37d7d> in <module>
----> 1 f(1)

<ipython-input-32-4f34043eb656> in f(x)
      1 def f(x):
----> 2     y = 1/(1 - x**2)
      3     return(y)

ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

```
In [37]: f('Mary')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-35-8547eae46f78> in <module>
----> 1 f('Mary')

<ipython-input-32-4f34043eb656> in f(x)
      1 def f(x):
----> 2     y = 1/(1 - x**2)
      3     return(y)

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'int'
```

Functions can have more than one argument, as in:

```
In [38]: def g(x, y): return x*y/(x**2 + y**2)
    ...: g(1, 1)
Out[38]: 0.5
```

Note that, in the definition of `g`, I have used a shorter way. Most programmers would make it longer, as I did previously for `f`.

## Homework

1. Write a Python function which, given three integers, returns `True` if any of them is zero, and `False` otherwise.

2. Write a Python function which, given three integers, returns `True` if they are in order from smallest to largest, and `False` otherwise.
