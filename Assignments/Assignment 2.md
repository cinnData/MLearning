# Assignment 2

## Introduction

This assignment is based on the example **The spam filter**. The objective is to try some variations of the filters developed in class.

## Questions

Q1. Change the features matrix by: (a) dropping the three `cap_` variables and (b) **binarizing** all the `word_` variables, transforming them into dummies for the occurrence of the corresponding word. Based on this new features matrix, develop two spam classifiers, one based on a **logistic regression** equation and the other one based on a **decision tree**, using the binarized data set.

Q2. Evaluate these classifiers based on their respective **confusion matrices**.
