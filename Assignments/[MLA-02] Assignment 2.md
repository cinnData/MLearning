# [MLA-02] Assignment 2

## Introduction

This assignment is based on the example MLE-05, focused on a **spam filter**. The objective is to try some variations of the filters developed in class.

## Questions

Q1. Train a **logistic regression** classifier with the data from the file `spam.csv` and compare its performance to the classifiers developed in this example.

Q2. Change the features matrix by: (a) dropping the three `cap_` variables and (b) **binarizing** all the `word_` variables, transforming them into dummies for the occurrence of the corresponding word. Based on this new features matrix, develop two spam classifiers, one based on a **logistic regression** equation and the other one based on a **decision tree**, using the binarized data set.

Q3. Evaluate these classifiers based on their respective **confusion matrices**.

## Submission

1. Submit, through Blackboard, a readable and printable report responding these questions and explaining what you have done, including Python input and output. This can be a Word document, a PDF document or a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb).

2. Put your name on top of the document.

## Deadline

February 18 (Sunday), 24:00.
